## Project Objectives
You have freedom to drive the project and make it your own. You are not limited to the project objectives. Use information from your LinkedIn page and previous resume to build a resume site using React. The purpose of this project is to explore using CSS with React. Focus more on exploring React and CSS rather than perfecting a professional resume site.  *You may always return to this project later.*

## Before you start

### Mock up your design
> *Weeks of coding saves hours of planning.*

Begin by creating a 'mock up' on scratch piece of paper.  Identify the 'high level' components you may want on your page.  Use information from your LinkedIn page and previous resume.  You should have an idea of  components you will need before you begin writing any code. 

Example of components
- Background component
- Layout Component
  - Title Component
  - Picture Component
  - Skills Component
  - Summary Component
  - Experience Component
